# DUMB CHARADES
Dumb Charade is an online multiplayer `acting` , `drawing` and `guessing` team game.

One team provide the word, while other team need to guess the word by drawing or acting from one of their team member.

I added `audio` and `text` chat in this application for better interaction with your friends.
